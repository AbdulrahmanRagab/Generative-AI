      "Page: Black Stone\n",
      "Summary: The Black Stone (Arabic: ٱلْحَجَرُ ٱلْأَسْوَد, romanized: al-Ḥajar al-Aswad) is a rock set into the eastern corner of the Kaaba, the ancient building in the center of the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. It is revered by Muslims as an Islamic relic which, according to tradition, dates back to the time of Adam and Eve.\n",
      "The stone was venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic Arabia. According to tradition, it was set intact into the Kaaba's wall by Muhammad in 605, five years before his first revelation. Since then, it has been broken into fragments and is now encased in a silver frame on the side of the Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented, dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. It has often been described as a meteorite, but it has never been analysed with modern techniques, so its scientific origins remain the subject of speculation.\n",
      "Muslim pilgrims circle the Kaaba as a part of the tawaf ritual during the Hajj and many try to stop to kiss the Black Stone, emulating the kiss that Islamic tradition records that it received from Muhammad. While the Black Stone is revered, theologians emphasize that it has no divine significance and that its importance is historical in nature.\n",

      "Page: Bilal ibn Rabah\n",
      "Summary: Bilal ibn Rabah (Arabic: بِلَال بْن رَبَاح, romanized: Bilāl ibn Rabāḥ; c. 5 March 580 - 2 March 640 CE), also known as Bilāl al-Ḥabashī or simply Bilal, was a close companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Born in Mecca, he was of Abyssinian (modern-day Ethiopia) descent and was formerly enslaved. He is considered the first muʾazzin (caller to prayer) in Islam, personally chosen by Muhammad for his deep and melodious voice.\n",
      " \n",
      "He was a former slave who called the Muslims to the daily obligatory prayers. According to Islamic tradition, Bilal was one of the earliest converts to Islam and is often regarded as the first African or Black Muslim. He died in 640 CE, around the age of 59.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Muhammad\n",
      "Summary: Muhammad (c. 570 – 8 June 632 CE) was an Arab religious, military and political leader and the founder of Islam. According to Islam, he was a prophet who was divinely inspired to preach and confirm the monotheistic teachings of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is believed by Muslims to be the Seal of the Prophets, and along with the Quran, his teachings and normative examples form the basis for Islamic religious belief.\n",
      "According to writers of Al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya, Muhammad was born in Mecca to the aristocratic Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh. He was the son of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib and Amina bint Wahb. His father, Abdullah, the son of tribal leader Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim, died around the time Muhammad was born. His mother Amina died when he was six, leaving Muhammad an orphan. He was raised under the care of his grandfather, Abd al-Muttalib, and paternal uncle, Abu Talib. In later years, he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, in c. 610, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave and receiving his first revelation from God. In 613, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that \"God is One\", that complete \"submission\" (Islām) to God (Allāh) is the right way of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to other prophets in Islam.\n",
      "Muhammad's followers were initially few in number, and experienced persecution by Meccan polytheists for 13 years. To escape ongoing persecution, he sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) later in 622. This event, the Hijrah, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an arm\n"

Loosely based on the picture book of the same name by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long, the plot concerns a women's magazine writer and an advertising executive who both begin a relationship with ulterior motives. While the story and characters in the film are original, the dating \"don'ts\" of the picture book are included in the film.\n",
      "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days was released theatrically in the United States on February 7, 2003, and was a box office success, grossing over $177.5 million against a production budget of $50 million. Despite this, the film garnered mixed reviews from critics, who praised Hudson and McConaughey's acting and chemistry, but criticized the script and predictable plot.\n",

      "TOOL: Page: Weight loss\n",
      "Summary: Weight loss, in the context of medicine, health, or physical fitness, refers to a reduction of the total body mass, by a mean loss of fluid, body fat (adipose tissue), or lean mass (namely bone mineral deposits, muscle, tendon, and other connective tissue). Weight loss can either occur unintentionally because of malnourishment or an underlying disease, or from a conscious effort to improve an actual or perceived overweight or obese state.  \"Unexplained\" weight loss that is not caused by reduction in calorific intake or increase in exercise is called cachexia and may be a symptom of a serious medical condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Page: Anti-obesity medication\n",
      "Summary: Anti-obesity medication or weight loss medications are pharmacological agents that reduce or control excess body fat. These medications alter one of the fundamental processes of the human body, weight regulation, by: reducing appetite and consequently energy intake, increasing energy expenditure, redirecting nutrients from adipose to lean tissue, or interfering with the absorption of calories.\n",
      "Weight loss drugs have been developed since the early twentieth century, and many have been banned or withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects, including deaths; other drugs proved ineffective. Although many earlier drugs were stimulants such as amphetamines, in the early 2020s, GLP-1 receptor agonists became popular for weight loss.\n",
      "The medications liraglutide, naltrexone/bupropion, orlistat, semaglutide, and tirzepatide are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for weight management in combination with reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. As of 2022, no medication has been shown to be as effective at long-term weight reduction as bariatric surgery.\n",

      "📤 Output: Page: Lung cancer\n",
      "Summary: Lung cancer, also called lung carcinoma, is a malignant tumor that originates in the tissues of the lungs. Lung cancer is caused by genetic damage to the DNA of cells in the airways, often caused by cigarette smoking or inhaling damaging chemicals. Damaged airway cells gain the ability to multiply unchecked, causing the growth of a tumor. Without treatment, tumors spread throughout the lung, damaging lung function. Eventually lung tumors metastasize, spreading to other parts of the body.\n",
      "Early lung cancer often has no symptoms and can only be detected by medical imaging. As the cancer progresses, most people experience nonspecific respiratory problems: coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Other symptoms depend on the location and size of the tumor. Those suspected of having lung cancer typically undergo a series of imaging tests to determine the location and extent of any tumors. Definitive diagnosis of lung cancer requires a biopsy of the suspected tumor be examined by a pathologist under a microscope. In addition to recognizing cancerous cells, a pathologist can classify the tumor according to the type of cells it originates from. Around 15% of cases are small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and the remaining 85% (the non-small-cell lung cancers or NSCLC) are adenocarcinomas, squamous-cell carcinomas, and large-cell carcinomas. After diagnosis, further imaging and biopsies are done to determine the cancer's stage based on how far it has spread.\n",
      "Treatment for early stage lung cancer includes surgery to remove the tumor, sometimes followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells. Later stage cancer is treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy alongside drug treatments that target specific cancer subtypes. Even with treatment, only around 20% of people survive five years on from their diagnosis. Survival rates are higher in those diagnosed at an earlier stage, diagnosed at a younger age, and in women compared to men.\n",
      "Most lung cancer cases are caused by tobacco smoking. The remainder are caused by exposure to hazardous substances like asbestos and radon gas, or by genetic mutations that arise by chance. Consequently, lung cancer prevention efforts encourage people to avoid hazardous chemicals and quit smoking. Quitting smoking both reduces one's chance of developing lung cancer and improves treatment outcomes in those already diagnosed with lung cancer.\n",
      "Lung cancer is the most diagnosed and deadliest cancer worldwide, with 2.2 million cases in 2020 resulting in 1.8 million deaths. Lung cancer is rare in those younger than 40; the average age at diagnosis is 70 years, and the average age at death 72. Incidence and outcomes vary widely across the world, depending on patterns of tobacco use. Prior to the advent of cigarette smoking in the 20th century, lung cancer was a rare disease. In the 1950s and 1960s, increasing evidence linked lung cancer and tobacco use, culminating in declarations by most large national health bodies discouraging tobacco use.\n",
